# Animal Game (_Jogo do Bicho_)

The Animal Game is a popular lottery-like game played in Brazil since the 1940s,
despite being ilegal for most of its existence, up until this day.

Every **lottery draw** contains five numbers with four digits each, from '0000' to '9999' and
players can make different kinds of bets. 

The most **common bet** is to pick one out of 25 possible animals. Each animal corresponds to
a group of four numbers.

The first animal is the Ostrich (_Avestruz_), and its numbers are: [01, 02, 03, 04], the next
is the Eagle (_√Åguia_) [05, 06, 07, 08], and so forth, up until the Cow (_Vaca_) [97, 98, 99, 00].

A player who bets on a single animal **wins** if any of the animals four numbers appear in the
last two digits of any of the five lottery draws. There are many other kinds of bets.

For instance, the same game described above can be played in 'dry' or 'head' mode, where the
player only wins if the chosen animal appears in the first out of the five draws. This is five
times less likely so the payout of this game mode is usually five times greater than the latter.

Players can also bet on specific numbers instead groups of numbers (animals). The bets are made
on the last two, three or four digits of the draws. If either of these bets are made in 'dry'
mode only the first draw of the lot is considered and the prize is five times greater.

Finally it is also possible to bet on two or three animals, or even 2 double digit numbers.


## What is this thing anyway?

- A bad excuse to use metaclasses. 
- A mini framework for easily creating different types of games and running simulations of the Animal Game.
- A random act of data exploration.
